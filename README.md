# Twitter React App

## Live Demo

[Twitter React](https://eedelosreyes2.github.io.twitter-react/)

## Version

1.0.0

## Specs

-   App is intended to look as close to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) as possible, utilizing reactive and reusable components
-   Optimized for desktop, tablet, and phone (try them all out!)
-   Not all icons are the same as real twitter. All icons used in this app are imported from [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
-   Not every single functionality from Twitter is implemented (I will add dark mode!)

## Changelog

-   v1.0.0 - MVP released

### TODO

-   CenterCol height
-   Fix weird stuff on phones
-   Post functionality:
    -   Show in home feed and profile, and likes
    -   Date posted
    -   likes and retweets, and wrappers, spacing
